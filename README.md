For those looking for a release, one is there, but it doesn't show up properly because it's labeled as a prerelease.

Original description:
# SUtopia - Sonic Utopia ReDecompiled

After 10 months...Sonic Utopia has been ReDecompiled with a newer version of AssetRipper!

# Differences between this Decomp and the Legacy Decomp

Everything is 1:1.

Working shaders.

NO additions at all. - I wanted to keep this as a pure vanilla decompilation so there's no DiscordRPC.

Different Unity version! - The legacy decomp uses 2019.4.17f1 (i think), while this one uses the version Sonic Utopia was made with (5.4.1f1)!

# Ports
